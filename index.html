      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I'm a Software Engineering Team Lead at <a href="https://tangoe.com" target="_blank" rel="referrer">Tangoe</a>
        for their Mobile product. Tangoe gives me the opportunity to learn every day and help other individuals grow
        into their roles. I am responsible for the personal growth and productivity of 6 Software Engineers who work in
        a Ruby on Rails and Angular/AngularJS technology stack.

              <h3>JavaScript</h3>
              <p>
                I started really writing JavaScript during my tenure with
                <a href="https://thebasement.tv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Basement</a>. I wrote a lot of
                vanilla JavaScript, but started down the EmberJS path there as well. At Octiv, I was tasked with working
                within an EmberJS and ReactJS environment. Moving on to Tangoe (previously MOBI), I worked primarily in
                an AngularJS environment and worked to move them into a more modern Angular 7+ JavaScript environment.

              <p>
                I have a secret enjoyment in Ruby, but have never set out to really master it. I wrote some Ruby at Octiv
                and write some Ruby at Tangoe, but I'm still pretty junior in this area. I have a couple of side projects
                that I am developing with Ruby on Rails to help me gain a better understanding of it.

                At Tangoe, I am a Software Engineering Team Lead and I manage 6 Software Engineers. Part of my
                responsibilities include helping each individual on my team grow professionally and personally. I aim to
                help each of my team members to reach their full professional potential. Prior to being a Team Lead at
                Tangoe, I was a Senior Front End Engineer. As a Senior Front End Engineer I began the process of moving
                the software from an AngularJS environment to an Angular 7+ environment. I have continued those efforts
                as a Team Lead by directing team members in that effort.

              <p>
                At Octiv, I was a Front End Engineer in an EmberJS, ReactJS and Ruby on Rails stack. I focused on Front
                End interactions for the company's product, but some of my work required that I be at least comfortable
                in a Rails environment. Octiv uses Agile development practices to move the product forward and Git for
                version control.
